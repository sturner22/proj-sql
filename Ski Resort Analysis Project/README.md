# Ski Resort Analysis SQL Project

This respository contains the SQL queries I wrote to analyze a dataset containing information on 500 ski resorts around the world. I also created a simple, interactive Excel dashboard to visually explore the data on a country and resort level. My dashboard doubles as a ski vacation planning tool! To access the data I used, [click here.](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/datasets)


### ski_resort_analysis

This file contains the SQL queries I wrote in MySQL workbench. I also included analysis questions and comments explaining the purpose of each query. 

### ski_resort_dashboard

I created a dashboard in Excel to display the results of my SQL analysis. I used advanced Excel formulas to display the data based on the user's selections. The dashboard has interactive features, including drop-down menu options and hyperlinks (download file to use interactive features. Note: The chart on the left is a filled map chart, which is not available in the browser version of Excel. The map chart will not show unless the file is downloaded with a compatible version of Excel). 

### ski_resort_dashboard_screenshot-1 & screenshot-2

Screenshots for a quick view of my Excel dashboard. In screenshot-1, the map represents the geographic distribution of the ski resorts contained in the dataset. On the upper right side of the dashboard, there is a drop-down menu for the user to choose a country. When a country is selected, the "Click for Resort Details" hyperlink will land on another sheet with more detail on every resort in the selected country (shown on screenshot-2). Finally, for those in the northern hemisphere looking for a summer ski vacation, the "Looking for a Summer Skiing Destination?" table allows the user to select a month and returns a result with each country and resort name with a season starting in the selected month.
