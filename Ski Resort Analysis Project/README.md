### ski_resort_analysis

This file contains the SQL queries I wrote in MySQL workbench. I also included analysis questions and comments explaining the purpose of each query. 

### ski_resort_dashboard

I created a dashboard in Excel to display the results of my SQL analysis. I used advanced Excel formulas to display the data based on the user's selections. The dashboard has interactive features, including drop-down menu options and hyperlinks (download file to use interactive features. Note: The chart on the left is a filled map chart, which is not available in the browser version of Excel. The map chart will not show unless the file is downloaded with a compatible version of Excel).
